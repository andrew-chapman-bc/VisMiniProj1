            <p>This is a good visualization because it scores high across the five principles. It uses a bar broken up into different colors depending on whether the scene is true or not. There is also a gradient to measure how true or how false a scene was. The color scheme is very pleasing to the eye. The reader can see if there is a trend that a movie tends to stretch the truth when retelling a story, or if it stayed faithful to the source material. In some cases it can help a reader catch an extreme, such as certain movies that are much less faithful or certain sections of a movie that stand out as being much less true than others. </p>

            <p>This is a good visualization across the five principles. Readers can compare the values of the various energy producers around the world and amount of energy produced by each type of energy source and draw conclusions. It answers lots of questions about our current energy needs, production and consumption. It is much easier to grasp the concept using this visualization as opposed to looking at raw data. The differences in energy are consistent and allow for users to gather knowledge on the topic. Some people might have very little idea on where energy comes from around the world or how their own country might stack up in certain areas. This visualization allows them to get a basic understanding of the data at a glance</p>

            <p>This is a good visualization because it follows the 5 principles of visualization while being accessible to the target audience. If people were looking to get a better understanding of fracking they would easily be able to grasp the concepts in a simple and interactive format. The fluid density of fracking liquids underground is encoded using a heatmap. This allows the user to easily compare the expected density map to the actual density map. Through factual data collection on a well in Oklahoma the amount and location of liquid, they could map it. It is quite visually appealing, with not much clutter and the heatmap is the focal point of the picture. There isn’t much distracting the user and each piece of information is labeled as the user keeps scrolling down the web page. Using the visualization, a reader could gain insight on the fracking industry and how the discrepancy from theory to reality impacts efficiency and potential leaking into other wells. This knowledge can be enlightening as fracking is a major point of discussion in our society and this could help inform people who look to educate themselves on the topic.</p>

            <p>This is a bad visualization for many reasons. It scored low on the functional, insightful and enlightening principles. The pie chart is not split into accurate proportions reflecting the percentages shown. It also fails to provide sufficient context for the reader to understand and interpret the chart, the little wording it uses being very vague, so it is difficult to draw any conclusions. It is unclear when “today” and “last year” is, the categories are not in the same units (days and years). The purpose of the chart is also unclear, as it is simply splitting up Americans who have tried marijuana into categories based on when they’ve tried it (regardless if it was the first and/or last time they have tried it) and completely leaves out information on Americans who have not tried marijuana.

              This is the best redesign because it fixes a lot of the issues from the original. It changes the pie chart to a line chart and places the year on the x-axis. This is less confusing because the time aspect is now exclusively in years and is also put on a chronological axis instead of categorizing. The y-axis is the percentage of Americans who have tried marijuana. This greatly clears up the confusion from the previous chart, as the percentage is now the percentage out of all Americans that have tried marijuana for each given year on the x-axis. The line shows a positive trend over time, so the reader can draw the conclusion that over time, the percentage of total Americans who have ever tried marijuana has increased.

              This is the best redesign because it fixes the issues from the original visualization while still keeping the same aesthetic. This version provides a legend and a title that provides context for the reader so that they have a clearer understanding of the significance of the data being shown. It also corrects the proportions of the pie chart by making them accurately reflect the 42% and 57% of the white voter population. This way the reader can accurately draw conclusions of where the majority of the white vote lied in the election. The red and blue contrast and still provide an easy way to spot the difference between the political parties.

The visual skews the data to make the Afghanistan War look significantly longer than the Vietnam War even though the difference is only 5 months,while the Vietnam War looks similar to the Iraq War even though it was over twice as long. The color scheme is also very dark and uniform between categories, however this part is less important in this case.</p>

              This is the best redesign for a few reasons. It scores high across all principles. There is now a legend that the reader can refer to, as well as a contrast in color between the different categories to make it clearer for the reader. The graph was changed into a bar graph to make it easier to compare visually for the reader. The scale was adjusted to accurately reflect the length of time that each war lasted. The reader can now draw accurate conclusions that while the Afghanistan War was the longest, Vietnam was a very close second.
